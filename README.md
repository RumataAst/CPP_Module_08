# CPP Module 08 - Iterators and Stack

## Overview
This module introduces **iterators** and**container** in C++, focusing on how to use iterators to traverse containers and work with the stack data structure.

## Key Topics
- **Iterators**: Traversing and manipulating elements in containers.
- **Container Adaptors**: Understanding how stack adapts the underlying container.

## Notes
- When evaluating project from colleague i discovered that behavior of std::isdigit is undefined if the argument's value is neither representable as unsigned char nor equal to EOF and it was crashing program.
